You are to write a program which will simulate the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some
pair of them will have the same birthday. The code provided to you will get the value of n, the size of the group
of people, and for the number of simulations to be run. For a single simulation, your program should generate a
random birthday for each person in the group of n people and determine whether or not there are two birthdays
that hit the same day. This simulation should be repeated the desired number of times, keeping track of the
number of simulations for which there were two birthdays on the same day. Once all simulations have been
completed, you are to compute the percentage of runs that had two birthdays on the same day and return that
value to the caller.
